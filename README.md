# Basics-of-c
Why were programming languages introduced?
They were introduced to solve problems that humans cannot solve efficiently on their own.C programming starts with the line #include <stdio.h>.#include <stdio.h> contains a standard library function so we include this functions in our program it is necessary to write for beginning of a program, but execution starts from main().that is int main(){ In int main(), int is very important because it is a data type.It specifies the type of value that the main function returns.
what is a Data type?A data type defines the type of data a variable can store and how much memory is required for it.
declaration of a variable:-
int a = 10;/here a is assigned to 10
int → data type
a → variable name
10 → integer value
