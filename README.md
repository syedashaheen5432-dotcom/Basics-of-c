# Basics-of-c
Why were programming languages introduced?
They were introduced to solve problems that humans cannot solve efficiently on their own.
The C programming starts with the line #include <stdio.h>.
#include <stdio.h> contains a standard library function.
so we include this functions in our program it is necessary to write for beginning of a program, but execution starts from main().
that is int main(){ .
In int main(), int is very important because it is a data type.
It specifies the type of value that the main function returns.
what is a Data type?
A data type defines the type of data a variable can store and how much memory is required for it.
Data types are keywords. they are reserved words used to declare variables and they have a predefined meaning.
when you declare a variable, you must use a data type keyword. keywords in always start with lower case and the keywords in c are:-
int-> stores whole numbers(integers)(ex:-0,1,..),
float-> stores decimal numbers with less precision(ex:-36.4,22.0,2.0.),
double-> stores decimal numbers with more precision(ex:-1235.87,3.1415926535),
character-> stores a single character(ex:-'A'),
declaration of a variable:-
int a = 10;/here a is assigned to 10
int → data type
a → variable name
10 → integer value
;-> is called full stop(statement terminator in c).
printf-> it is a libary function which is use to dislpay the is used to display the output.it shows output not input.
printf-> print on the screen it belongs to the standard I/O library (stdio.h).
printf("Hello");-> Hello will be displayed on the screen.it will not occupy any storage it is a dummy statement.
Now before discussing about scanf we have to know about Format specifier.
A Format specifier is a special symbol used in C to tell the compiler what type of data is being input or output.
